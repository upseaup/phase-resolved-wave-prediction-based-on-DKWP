# The phase-resolved wave prediciton based on DKWP  
A phase-resolved wave prediction model by combining deep learning with the Koopman theory (DKWP) is designed.  
The data is obtained by HOS-NWT (https://github.com/LHEEA/HOS-NWT)   
Meanwhile, the data sets are open in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vnJIMQji0g9jFczP3CQFzuKy3FGnctsy/view, due to the github can not load the files that are larger than 100 MiB.  
Besides, the codes are also in the link.  
You can run dkwp-random-s35-z450-dt04-ad-9-7.ipynb to train the model.    
You can run dkwp-random-s35-z450-dt04-picture.ipynb to draw the predicted wave elevation by the DKWP.
